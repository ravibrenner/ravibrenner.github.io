Masters in Biostatistics student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with a concentration in Public Health Data Science.

I am a biostatistician and epidemiologist with experience using mathematical modeling, data analysis, and data visualization to support better health outcomes. I enjoy applying technical tools like R, Python, and SQL alongside strong writing and communication skills to tackle real-world challenges in public health. My interests include infectious disease epidemiology, health policy, vaccine-preventable diseases, HIV care, health communication, and looking for ways that data can inform public health action.

This website contains a bit about me and my work and educational [experiences](resume.html).
