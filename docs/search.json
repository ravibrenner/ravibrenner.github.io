    "text": "Welcome to the blog section of my website!\nMy name is Ravi, and I am a data-driven public health professional, with training as a biostatistician and experience with epidemiology and health policy. I have mainly worked on infectious disease in various capacities, both in academic research and in government public health.\nI started my professional career working on agent-based modeling projects at the Medical Practice Evaluation Center (MPEC) at Mass General Hospital. I primarily worked with Doctors Anne Neilan and Andrea Ciaranello on research related to youth with HIV in the US and South Africa. I also got the opportunity there to work on some primary data analysis projects related to COVID-19 in schools. After 2 years there, I began working in the Office of Science at the New York State Department of Health on emerging health science and outbreak response. I then took a break from working to learn some new skills in graduate school at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am also currently working part time at the Meyers lab at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center (ADARC), creating dashboards and doing data analysis to support clinics rolling out the next generation of injectable HIV treatment options.\nMore generally, I am interested in using data to inform public health action. I really enjoy the simulation modeling approach to this, since it is a fantastic way to understand the potential impact of different decisions. It can be complex and intellectually stimulating, and you can execute it when data is plentiful and when it is scarce. That said, I am also a big believer that sometimes the most important analysis needed is the simple one that can be executed quickly and disseminated effectively. Because of this, I also have a strong interest in communicating my analysis work to a broad audience. I enjoy creating different kinds of data visualizations and helping others to understand them, and am always interested in opportunities to teach to others.\nIn my non-work life I enjoy running, cycling, baking, and playing with our dog Maggie, a 2-year-old Australian Labradoodle (pictured).\nMy goal with this blog is to showcase some of my past work in more detail, discuss interests of mine in the public health field, and explore topics I am learning in more detail. I also hope it will provide an avenue for me to improve my writing and communication skills.\n\n\n\nMaggie with the sunsest behind her"

We also categorized the different diseases based on the number of nodes (the size of the outbreak) and the number of clusters (superspreaders) and some interesting patterns emerged.\n\n\nBike Lanes and Bike Collisions in New York City\nThis was the final project for my public health GIS class, taught by Dr. Joel Capellan. The final poster I produced with my findings is available as a powerpoint file in this github repo with all my other work. This subject was personally interesting for me because I bike for exercise and occasionally for commuting in New York City. I had wanted to undertake an analysis of bike safety in New York but felt daunted by the sheer size of the data shared by NYC on their Open Data portal. The vehicle collision data is very large, and wrangling that data was a challenge. On top of that, for this analysis I was dealing with points (where crashes occurred), line segments (where bike lanes were present), and polygons (where different community districts are located). So connecting all those geometries took some thought and decision making.\n\n\n\nOne map I produced for this project\n\n\nThis project also illuminated for me how challenging this type of research can be. The data NYC provides is very good and detailed, but still not enough to make any definitive conclusions about safety, because traffic volumes on each line segments are unknown. There are some traffic volumes provided by NYC at specific locations, but it’s hard to extrapolate from that to the whole city. Still, it was a fun data visualization project, and our professor kindly printed out our posters in full size for our presentation day.\n\n\nSimulation of Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Tree-Based Models\nThis last project is a more technical and theoretical machine learning project, for the course “Topics in Statistical Learning & Data Mining” taught by Dr. Min Qian. I still think it was very interesting to work on, and even those who are not data scientists, statisticians, or machine learning engineers can benefit from learning about this. The final report I produced is available as a PDF in this github repo for the project.\nVery briefly, the project attempts to explore and understand the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. The basic idea is that when you create a model to try to predict some outcome, the goal is to minimize some kind of error. You can show with some math that the error can be broken down into 2 components, called the bias and the variance. The bias tells you how far your predictions are from the truth, and the variance tells you how varied your predictions are. It turns out that these 2 things are somewhat in conflict, such that decreasing the bias means increasing the variance, and vice versa.\n\n\n\nPhoto from wikipedia\n\n\nIt’s the sort of thing that is often glossed over quickly at the beginning of a data science class, but its very important to understand, especially as AI becomes more ubiquitous. Today’s generative large language models are far more complicated than the models I explored in this paper, but they too suffer from the bias-variance tradeoff. This project was a cool way to explore how I could bridge theoretical constructs and actual data analysis, and I came away feeling like I understood this concept in a way I really hadn’t before."

    "text": "These are a few of the projects I have worked on in some of my past public health jobs. This is a sampling of final products, since there were plenty of other interesting projects that I worked on that didn’t turn into publications. More on those in another post in the future!\n\nHIV and COVID-19\nThis paper, Projecting the Clinical and Economic Impacts of Changes to HIV Care Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States: Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic was the first modeling paper that I got to work on from start to finish, under the supervision of Dr. Anne Neilan and a great team of collborators through the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN). We wanted to understand what impact disruptions in HIV care due to COVID-19 would have on youth with HIV in the United States. We chose to focus specifically on the treatment side (rather than HIV prevention), and found that even short interruptions to HIV care may have negative long-term clinical implications (PDF is here).\nFor my part, I did literature reviews to understand the (early) state of research on the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care. I paid special attention to metrics like treatment adherence, loss to follow-up, and treatment failure among youth with HIV. I also helped to derive new youth-specific HIV care cost inputs for the model. Then we settled on a few strategies that we wanted to test, and I set up all the corresponding model runs and analyzed and visualized the data. Finally I helped with drafting and editing the paper, with much help from Dr. Neilan and the other co-authors.\nIn many ways, this was a speculative and exploratory paper. We were able to leverage some ATN data on youth with and without perinatal HIV to develop new model inputs unique to each population, which was a cool innovation. While not specifically what we modeled, I do think that in some ways we are now seeing the impact of these COVID care interruptions, nearly 6 years later. Data released by NYC this year show an uptick in new HIV diagnoses. That probably relates more to the prevention side of things than the treatment side, but its an unfortunate development nonetheless.\n\n\nCOVID-19 in Schools\nAnother set of analyses I was involved in related to COVID-19 contact tracing in Massachusetts schools. The first paper was Evaluation of “Test to Return” after COVID-19 Diagnosis in a Massachusetts Public School District and the second paper was Prevalence and Risk Factors for School-Associated Transmission of SARS-CoV-2. For both papers, we relied on data meticulously collected by school nurses and administrators in 2020 and 2021 on all cases and close contacts in their schools. I was not involved in designing the studies or collecting the data, but I was heavily involved in the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization for both studies.\nFor the test-to-return analysis, we wanted to know whether having students test before returning to school vs. waiting for a set number of days was better in terms of preventing infection and maximizing days spend in school. Ultimately we could not answer these questions with certainty, but we did find that a substantial proportion of students were still testing positive and may still be contagious 6 days after the onset of infection. Therefore if schools forgo testing to return to school, they should know that there may be some infectious students returning (PDF here).\nFor the school-associated transmission analysis, we were working with very complicated and messy data from a larger number of schools, so data cleaning was a substantial challenge. There was also a relatively small number of “events,” so the statistical analysis also proved an interesting challenge. The goal of the paper was simply to measure the secondary attack rate and factors associated with transmission in schools. Masking (prior to vaccine introduction) and full vaccination proved to be the strongest protectors against in-school transmission. The good news from this study was that secondary attack rates were relatively low, indicating that the preventative measures used were fairly effective and in-school learning could be resumed relatively safely (PDF here).\nDr. Nelson, Dr. Ciaranello, and other co-authors were involved in school COVID-19 policies in Massachusetts and nationally, and these studies were just part of the research base they were contributing to and drawing on. It was a challenging area of research, both from a data perspective and politically, and I hope that the work they did will prove useful the next time there is a disruptive pandemic.\n\n\nPolio in New York State\nI worked a lot on Polio while working at NYSDOH, but these were two papers that were actually published, led by the nonprofit modeling group Kid Risk. The papers were Modeling Poliovirus Transmission and Responses in New York State and Modeling undetected poliovirus circulation following the 2022 outbreak in the United States. My role in both of these was to provide a lot of the data on vaccination rates and the population at risk, and to help develop the modeling scenarios and visualizations.\nThe first paper provided an overview of the potential number of polio infections and paralytic cases under different mixing scenarios. We found that even when average IPV immunization rates are high, clusters of undervaccinated populations mean that imported polioviruses may circulate and pose a small but nonzero risk of causing paralysis in nonimmune individuals (PDF here).\nThe second paper was a bit more technical. We had been seeing wastewater samples positive for poliovirus, but no cases showing up with paralysis. Eventually we stopped seeing these detections, but it wasn’t clear that a negative sample meant that no one had polio. We wanted to know how confident we could be in no circulation based on the timing of the last positive wasterwater sample. We found that depending on the assumptions of population mixing and wastewater sampling quality, public health officials could assume 95% confidence of no ongoing circulation of the outbreak poliovirus within approximately 3–10 months since the last positive wastewater sample (PDF here.\nThese projects were a great experience for me, to see how modeling is used in a real outbreak setting. I also worked on some (unpublished) models internally for NYSDOH and in collaboration with CDC. The modeling was useful information to help us contextualize the risk: polio was probably not going to become endemic in New York, at least not in 2022-2023. Still, it did not solve the problem of how to increase on-time childhood vaccination (a topic for another day)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Fear of needles\nWhen I was 17, I drove myself to the pediatrician for the first time, without my parents. After most of the physical exam had concluded, my doctor asked me if I wanted to get the relatively new meningococcal B vaccine. The CDC had recently recommended MenB vaccine for “individual clinical decision making.” I was at the right age to receive the vaccine, and there was a low but meaningful risk of the disease on college campuses at the time.\nI was and remain terrified of needles (like over half of adults). My pediatrician knew this, since I had nearly passed out in his office a few years prior. The vaccine was new, and based on the relatively weak recommendation from the CDC ACIP, he told me: “You can probably skip this one.” With no parents there to tell me otherwise, that’s exactly what I did.\nI diligently, if nervously, got all my flu shots in college. I even took myself to get a Tdap booster, after which I nearly fainted and had to lie down with a juice box at age 22. I jumped at the opportunity to get the single-dose J&J COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 because it meant I only had to get a single dose. I have never even attempted to give blood, since the couple of times I have had blood drawn, it has been a challenge to remain conscious. I try my best to put on a brave face, but even the sight of a needle on TV makes me lightheaded.\n\n\n\nMy roommate and I getting our COVID-19 booster doses in late 2021\n\n\nI completely understand the fear some people have of vaccines. Even if you can put up with the needles, which I can, its still unpleasant. Your arm hurts, you might feel off for a few days afterward. The weight-loss-drugmakers know this and are creating oral options. There are some oral and nasal vaccine options, but they haven’t been developed for all diseases and the performance of the vaccine can vary a bit. So for many people, they have to overcome a real fear to get vaccinated.\nThere’s a social component too. In college, there was a flu vaccine “fair” in the main student center, which all my friend attended and where some of my friends volunteered. There was a lot of (positive) peer pressure to get vaccinated.\n\n\n\nAn Outbreak in New York\nIn July 2022, I started a new job in the Office of Science at the New York State Department of Health. Just a few days in (I was still getting my computer set up), my boss called. “We don’t know for sure yet,” he said, “but we think there is a person hospitalized with polio down state.” “Polio?” I asked, puzzled. I genuinely thought we had eliminated polio from the US. Turns out that we had, and that this case was likely imported from abroad by a traveler to another country.\nThere was no team set up to deal with a polio outbreak. So several teams across NYSDOH and CDC, including our own, got to work. My boss had a specific ask for me. Could we estimate how many people were at risk of getting polio, and how many cases might we see in New York?\nThe case and subsequent outbreak occurred in the state’s significant Haredi Jewish community. While I am not Haredi myself, I grew up in the Modern Orthodox Jewish community in upstate New York. I knew plenty of religious Jews, including some who did not generally vaccinate themselves or their children. So when my boss asked how many people were at risk of getting polio, it was a question about understanding the dynamics of this community in particular.\nThis was not the first vaccine-preventable disease outbreak in this particular community (there had been mumps and measles within recent memory). Haredi Jews tend to have large families, so there were always young children vulnerable to these diseases being born. Each new outbreak led to a similar pattern: some parents would have their children immunized, and other children would get sick and survive with immunity, only for a new disease to show up a few years later for the cycle to repeat.\nFollowing the 2018-2019 measles outbreak, the state eliminated non-medical exemptions to most vaccines for school entry. This worked, to a point. Some schools never complied, there have been occasional episodes of fraud, and some parents just delayed vaccination until school entry, leaving their children under 5 vulnerable. There was a lot of anti-vaccine sentiment in the community.\n\n\n\nMeasles vaccination rates in New York State\n\n\nHonestly, I understood where they were coming from. There is frequent scrutiny by the state government and the media over how Haredi Jews run their schools. So when state officials came to them begging, once again, to bring their children in for vaccines, many parents were skeptical. Many parents were young and themselves not vaccinated. It wasn’t the social norm to get vaccinated, and it certainly wasn’t the norm to trust the government, or worse, faraway doctors whose vaccines did not appear to prevent repeated outbreaks from occurring.\nWe worked hard to come up with solutions, to rebuild trust so that people would choose to vaccinate their children. But ultimately it was a problem that took years to create, and one that will take years to solve.\n\n\n\nWhat to do?\nFast forward to 2026, and obviously we have not solved this problem. Distrust in vaccines, and in public health in general, is higher than ever. HHS, led by RFK Jr., has removed some vaccine recommendations, and his handpicked leader of ACIP has questioned the need for polio and measles vaccines entirely.\nVaccine acceptance can be thought of as a spectrum or pyramid. At the bottom are those who receive all recommended doses. Then there are smaller segments of people that are hesitant or selective. They may get some vaccines, but maybe not all on the recommended schedule. At the top, the smallest group of people, are the decliners who receive no vaccines under any circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe vaccine pyramid\n\n\nRecently Dr. Paul Offit called RFK Jr. a “vaccine cynic” which I agree is a much better term for him than “skeptic.” Skepticism is normal, and a healthy part of the scientific process. We should be skeptical of new vaccines and medical treatments, and carefully scrutinize the evidence when deciding whether to use them. That is just what scientists, doctors, and regular people all over the country have done for decades. I think that is what most people do who are hesitant or selective about vaccines. RFK Jr. and his supporters in the government are not like that. They contort evidence to fit their preconceived conclusions, a complete inversion of the scientific method.\nI have a lot of empathy for those unsure about vaccines. Needles are scary. We don’t always feel we can trust what scientists and government officials are saying. I completely understand how someone might hear that vaccines don’t work or are unsafe and simply decide that its not worth it for them that day. I hope they can be persuaded otherwise one day.\nI have a harder time understanding the vaccine cynic position. For me, its hard to understand why RFK Jr. is so opposed to vaccines, and why so many people find that view appealing. For a public health communications class, I recently read an article about “identity protection cognition”: basically the idea that people’s beliefs are downstream of their group identity. I think that is at least part of the answer, and something that effects us all. The author, Dan Kahan, also points out that those with the most scientific knowledge are often the most polarized. As someone with a good amount of scientific knowledge myself, I don’t want to fall into that trap. One fear I have about the public health field today is that we risk becoming so (reasonably!) angry by attacks on science that we risk losing our empathy for those who don’t share our views. Empathy which is non-negotiable in public health.\nFor my own part, I am interested in understanding why people choose not to vaccinate and how they can be persuaded to do so. I am far from an expert on this (and I’m sure this post violates some “best practices” in that area), but I hope to lead with empathy and transparency in the work that I do."
