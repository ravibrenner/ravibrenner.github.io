    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the blog section of my website!\nMy name is Ravi, and I am a data-driven public health professional, with training as a biostatistician and experience with epidemiology and health policy. I have mainly worked on infectious disease in various capacities, both in academic research and in government public health.\nI started my professional career working on agent-based modeling projects at the Medical Practice Evaluation Center (MPEC) at Mass General Hospital. I primarily worked with Doctors Anne Neilan and Andrea Ciaranello on research related to youth with HIV in the US and South Africa. I also got the opportunity there to work on some primary data analysis projects related to COVID-19 in schools. After 2 years there, I began working in the Office of Science at the New York State Department of Health on emerging health science and outbreak response. I then took a break from working to learn some new skills in graduate school at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am also currently working part time at the Meyers lab at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center (ADARC), creating dashboards and doing data analysis to support clinics rolling out the next generation of injectable HIV treatment options.\nMore generally, I am interested in using data to inform public health action. I really enjoy the simulation modeling approach to this, since it is a fantastic way to understand the potential impact of different decisions. It can be complex and intellectually stimulating, and you can execute it when data is plentiful and when it is scarce. That said, I am also a big believer that sometimes the most important analysis needed is the simple one that can be executed quickly and disseminated effectively. Because of this, I also have a strong interest in communicating my analysis work to a broad audience. I enjoy creating different kinds of data visualizations and helping others to understand them, and am always interested in opportunities to teach to others.\nIn my non-work life I enjoy running, cycling, baking, and playing with our dog Maggie, a 2-year-old Australian Labradoodle (pictured).\nMy goal with this blog is to showcase some of my past work in more detail, discuss interests of mine in the public health field, and explore topics I am learning in more detail. I also hope it will provide an avenue for me to improve my writing and communication skills.\n\n\n\nMaggie with the sunsest behind her"

There is also a github repo containing some of the work I did on this project. We chose to look at infectious disease transmission trees because they provide an interesting was of understanding outbreak dynamics. You can calculate the basic reproductive number \\(R_0\\) from a transmission tree by calculating the average out-degree of a node in the network (the out-degree is just the number of arrows pointing out of the node). However once an outbreak is completed, this will be &lt;1, so you have to exclude some share of the nodes to calculate the “true” \\(R_0\\). It’s a good reminder that basic reproductive numbers are probabilistic and influenced by the specific dynamics of an outbreak and the qualities of the disease. For example, the number of clusters influences the average \\(R_0\\), and identifies superspreaders at the same time, but these two things may have a somewhat inverse relationship. Diseases that spread quickly (like measles) may actually have fewer “superspreaders” in a strict sense, because basically everyone is transmitting at a high rate.

You can calculate the basic reproductive number \\(R_0\\) from a transmission tree by calculating the average out-degree of a node in the network (the out-degree is just the number of arrows pointing out of the node).

We also categorized the different diseases based on the number of nodes (the size of the outbreak) and the number of clusters (superspreaders) and some interesting patterns emerged.\n\n\nBike Lanes and Bike Collisions in New York City\nThis was the final project for my public health GIS class, taught by Dr. Joel Capellan. The final poster I produced with my findings is available as a powerpoint file in this github repo with all my other work. This subject was personally interesting for me because I bike for exercise and occasionally for commuting in New York City. I had wanted to undertake an analysis of bike safety in New York but felt daunted by the sheer size of the data shared by NYC on their Open Data portal. The vehicle collision data is very large, and wrangling that data was a challenge. On top of that, for this analysis I was dealing with points (where crashes occurred), line segments (where bike lanes were present), and polygons (where different community districts are located). So connecting all those geometries took some thought and decision making.\n\n\n\nOne map I produced for this project\n\n\nThis project also illuminated for me how challenging this type of research can be. The data NYC provides is very good and detailed, but still not enough to make any definitive conclusions about safety, because traffic volumes on each line segments are unknown. There are some traffic volumes provided by NYC at specific locations, but it’s hard to extrapolate from that to the whole city. Still, it was a fun data visualization project, and our professor kindly printed out our posters in full size for our presentation day.\n\n\nSimulation of Bias-Variance Tradeoff with Tree-Based Models\nThis last project is a more technical and theoretical machine learning project, for the course “Topics in Statistical Learning & Data Mining” taught by Dr. Min Qian. I still think it was very interesting to work on, and even those who are not data scientists, statisticians, or machine learning engineers can benefit from learning about this. The final report I produced is available as a PDF in this github repo for the project.\nVery briefly, the project attempts to explore and understand the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. The basic idea is that when you create a model to try to predict some outcome, the goal is to minimize some kind of error. You can show with some math that the error can be broken down into 2 components, called the bias and the variance. The bias tells you how far your predictions are from the truth, and the variance tells you how varied your predictions are. It turns out that these 2 things are somewhat in conflict, such that decreasing the bias means increasing the variance, and vice versa.\n\n\n\nPhoto from wikipedia\n\n\nIt’s the sort of thing that is often glossed over quickly at the beginning of a data science class, but its very important to understand, especially as AI becomes more ubiquitous. Today’s generative large language models are far more complicated than the models I explored in this paper, but they too suffer from the bias-variance tradeoff. This project was a cool way to explore how I could bridge theoretical constructs and actual data analysis, and I came away feeling like I understood this concept in a way I really hadn’t before."
